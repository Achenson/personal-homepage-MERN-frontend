Typescript & tailwing manual updated:

tailwind ccs && typescript:

1. npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript !!
2. npm i -D tailwindcss postcss-cli autoprefixer 
2.5 npm i -D  postcss !
3. npx tailwind init tailwind.js --full (all settings will be visible) 
(for some reason has to be tailwind.js not tailwind.config.js!)
4. change tailwind.js name, so it won't work anymory, but all settings can be checked
5. npx tailwind init tailwind.js 
(this time without -- full flag -> in this file we will put only our custom settings)
6. postcss.config.js -> 

const tailwindcss = require("tailwindcss");
module.exports = {
  plugins: [tailwindcss("./tailwind.js"), require("autoprefixer")],
};

7.  src/assets/main.css

    src/assets/tailwind.css
    @import "tailwindcss/base";
    @import "tailwindcss/components";
    @import "tailwindcss/utilities";

8. delete both .ccs file in root, delete react logo

9. package.json:

"start": "npm run watch:css && react-scripts start",
"build": "npm run build:css && react-scripts build",
   ...
"build:css": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/main.css",
"watch:css": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/main.css"

10. Tailwind css intelisense extension (reinstall if not working)

11.  index.tsx 

    import './assets/main.css';

!!!!!
12. after every change in config file (tailwind.js) run npm run build:css
(run it once at the beginning!)
!!!!!

13. purgecss when finished with the project:

exampe in tailwind.js: 
  purge: {
    content: ["./src/**/*.html", "./src/**/*.ts", "./src/**/*.tsx"],
    safelist: [
      /^bg/,
      /^ring/,
      /^hover:text/,
      /^text/,
      /^border/,
      /^hover:bg/,
      /^w-/
    ],

- all classes that won't be purged should be included as a plain text, no js!
- css will be purged when "enabled: true," line is added to tailwind.js (see notes serverside)
(old note: NODE_ENV is set to production
 automatically after build command in create-react-app ??) 

53. RSS -> proxy server or fetching from backend


NOTES: 
1. make background extend with the content: min-h-screen! (min-height: 100vh;)
  for image: bg-cover bg-fixed(so the image doesn't scale with contene, )
2. Last Gap in a Column - 
 Column: overflow-hidden & Gap: h-full (height: 100%) not working because EditTab
 and edit bookmakr need overflow
 solution: absolute invisible last gap stretching screen height (flex-grow)
3. Grid closeAllTabs is being set to false on the next render after it is being set to true
6. fixed too many renders in newTab_UpperUI: initialTags could have not been a var in component:
in that case the value would be calc on each render which would cause useEffect to crash the app (too many renders)
instead: initialTags in useState.
7. hooks lifeCycle: useEffect is called when everything is rendered. Just before that, previous cleanup effect is calleed
child component is called after everything is done in parent component
Anytime something is changed, the code for component runs from the begining. But lazy state initialization is omitten
UseEffect does not wait for any change - instead it wait until some state changes
8. going back one commit: select prev commit in git history 2. git pull 3. resolving conflicts (accept current chagne) 4. git add * 5. git commit
9. Regex: word boundaries! (^ & &). in newRegex \ needs to be escaped (because it has special meaning in stringe. eg. \n)! but / dont (but it has to be ecspaped in normal
regex becaus / / are used to open/close regex) 
10. absulute positioning with width taken form other element eg. input: wrap them with div (relative pos) with same style as input (but leave styles on input also!)
11. useQuery: to get different queries throughout the app, names of the queries need to be different! (here: tabID)
12. disabling cors on chrome:
shortcut with: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-web-security --disable-gpu --user-data-dir=~/chromeTemp
13. proper background visibility with whole column on drag effect:
additional div on Grid (so there is space for colors/editable), Grid - overflow-hidden
14. Tab setTimout: useEffect, unmounting necessary!
15. Main -> manipulating document body directy for hidding scrollbar -> fine, because
react is manipulatin only #app & everything below, no possible conflict with anything above #app
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39962757/prevent-scrolling-using-css-on-react-rendered-components
16. uneven input length fix: flex-none on labels on the left (that way the arbitrary width can be set)
